# Power meter display (pmd)    
Repository for code related to project described at See https://owenduffy.net/blog/?p=25710

pmd uses an Arduino Nano and SSD1306 OLED display to read the analogue voltage from a half wave detector and calculate power using a polynomial conversion function.

Instance parameters are stored in EEPROM.

A custom version of Optiboot v8.1 that will read and write EEPROM is included in the repo.
